# Cute files

This is a node.js command line utility that turns the current working directory into a pretty online file browser, available to all computers in the local network. It is an easy way to share a folder with your office buddies.

## Design and inspiration

It is based on [tutorialzine's file browser tutorial](http://tutorialzine.com/2014/09/cute-file-browser-jquery-ajax-php/). See a live demo [here](http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2014/09/cute-file-browser-jquery-ajax-php/).
